10M items each, divided into 512 sections each
32 bits real, 32 bits imaginary per unit

Change size to 8M datasets for each modulation_scheme.
Want to reshape to 512 x 2 arrays (512 real, 512 imaginary)

--Newest
Current setup:
One input would contain 512 datapoints, consisting of real and imaginary values.

	1	2	...	512
1	real 	real  	real   	real
2   	imag	imag	imag	imag
...
8M/512-1 real	real 	real	real	
8M/512	imag	imag	imag	imag

There are 8M 'datapoints' in each file, for a total of 8M*5 = 40M datapoints. Each 'input' consists of 512 datapoints, so there are 40M/512 = 78125 samples. There is a split of 60%/20%/20% for training/validating/testing, so 0.6*78125 = 46,875 for testing, 0.2*78125 = 15,625 for validating and testing each.
